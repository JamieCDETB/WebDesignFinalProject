# WebDesignFinalProject
Final Project Template for Web Design 4N1122

Your final project for Web Design 4N1122 is divided into two parts :

    + Practical Project (75%)
    + Project Report (25%)

Below is a more detailed breakdown of what you will need to complete for each part of the project

## Practical Project (75%)

For your website you will need to make sure that you hit each of the following points. We have covered most of these in class, and if you are unsure you can ask me for help.

    * Minimum of 2 pages, with internal links to and from home page included

    * Use an RGB / RGBA colour scheme throughout.

    * At least two external links, one as part fo text and one as an image

    * Use images that fit on and suit the page

    * Use both ordered and unordered lists correctly

    * Use HTML tags correctly

    * Text should have different formats, including
        - Bold
        - Italics
        - Different Font Size
        - Different Font Colours

## Project Report (25%)

For this part of the project you will need to write about your website, being sure that you comment on each of the points below.

You can use this document to write your report. There are some pointers for using Markdown (.md) below, as it does not work like we are used to in Word.

In your Project Report you must :

    * Describe the structure of your website
        - This should include how each page is laid out and why this is part of good Web Design.
        - You should also explain how you link between different pages, and why you have spread your content out over a number of pages.

    * Discuss the features of a good website
        - You can do your own research for this, but you should explain how websites should be laid out, how colours should be used and what accessibility requirements should be included when designing a website.

## Using Markdown (.md) files

As you can see, this files does not work quite like MS Word. We have to manually type out how we want our text styled in the body (like I have done above with the headings).

Here are some useful pointers to make your report easier to read.

- You can use 'Hashtags' (#) for headings. One symbol is the main heading, two is a sub-heading, three is a sub-sub-heading, etc...
You should only have a single Main Heading in the document so it is easy to navigate.

- You can create **bold** text by adding two asterisk (*) on either side of a word.

- You can create *italic* text by adding a single asterisk (*) either sire of a word.

- You can add ***Bold and Italics*** to a word by using three asterisks (*) either side of the word.

If you have any other questions you should ask! This can be kind of confusing to use the first time so don't worry if it gets annoying.
